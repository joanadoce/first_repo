    <h2>Why am I here &amp; What am I doing?</h2>
    <p> 
      Over the course of the day, you'll be putting your new-found HTML and CSS knowledge to use by creating your choice of either a) a resume or b) a company landing page. They both cover similar material. The assignment will have you building an example but you can substitute the content with your own, or just be creative and conjure your favourite fictional character's or company's landing page. 
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
      Hopefully you have already downloaded and installed Google Chrome and Adobe Brackets, as those will be the apps you need to create your landing page. If not, there's still time to get them now. 

      Either visit the links below and follow their instructions, or <em>use the USB keys floating around so you don't have to wait</em>.

      <h3>Download Links</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Google Chrome</em> - <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Adobe Brackets</em> - <a href="http://brackets.io/">http://brackets.io/</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once those two apps are installed, open up the appropriate instructions file (depending on your project choice). These contain the instructions and files you'll need for the day. Start off by using Google Chrome to open the appropriate instructions html file and follow the step-by-step instructions. 
    </p>

    <h2>Tips</h2>

    <h3>Help</h3>
    <p>
      Remember, <em>you're not alone</em>. Ask the volunteer developers any questions you may have about the lecture, the assignment, or HTML and CSS in general. Also refer to the HTML and CSS cheat sheets contained within the "cheat_sheets" folder. These will act as great references for many vocabulary and syntax questions you may have.

    <h3>Live Preview</h3>
    <p>
      One cool feature in Brackets is the ability to see live updates of your site as you code in HTML and CSS. From within Brackets, with your index.html file open, go to the File &raquo;&raquo; Live Preview. The Live Preview feature will open a Google Chrome window that will automatically update as you type and make changes to your page. Keeping both windows open next to each other using Live Preview is a more interactive and helpful way to build your first landing page, but it's up to you if you find it useful. <em>Make sure to save your files often</em>, however, as a change to your code files is only made when the file is saved.
    </p>

    <h3>Share Your Work</h3>

    <p>
      Upon completing your resume or company page, you can use our <em><a href="http://publisher.thehtml500.com/" target="_blank">website publisher</a></em> to publish and share it with your friends and family.
